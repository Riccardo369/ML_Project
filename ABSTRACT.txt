Project developing started with developing by Riccardo of neural network's structure and developing by Mirko of simulator.
The model is a FeedForward network realized with numpy uses minibatch algorithm with MSE loss for training with backprogpation 
algorithm to computer the gradient. it uses weight decay and momentum as regularization techiniques.
Technique used for validation are: K-fold Cross validation + HoldOut. For the CUP it is used model inside file FFCUP,
that file includes also model selection for CUP. Hyper-parameters selected for CUP is: {learning_rate, 0.0001, weight_decay, 0.0001,
momentum, 0.1, batch_size, 10.0, error_percent, 1.0}.
